Yes, your project implements several caching mechanisms to improve performance:

### Backend Caches:

1. **Embedding Cache**: 
   ```python
   embedding_cache = {}
   ```
   This cache stores computed embeddings for QA blocks to avoid recalculating them for the same content. When searching across documents, this significantly reduces computation time.

2. **PDF Parse Cache**:
   ```python
   pdf_parse_cache = {}
   ```
   This cache stores parsed PDFs keyed by filepath and modification time, preventing redundant parsing of the same document.

3. **Context Blocks Cache**:
   ```python
   context_blocks_cache: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
   CACHE_TTL = 300  # 5 minutes TTL
   ```
   This stores query results with a 5-minute time-to-live, so identical queries don't repeat the expensive retrieval process.

4. **Preloaded QA Blocks**:
   ```python
   preloaded_qa_blocks = []
   ```
   Acts as a global cache of all parsed QA blocks, loaded on startup to eliminate parsing time for first-time queries.

### Frontend Caches:

1. **Conversation Cache**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('conversations', JSON.stringify(conversationsWithoutImages));
   ```
   Stores conversation history in localStorage (though more for persistence than performance).

2. **Parallel Request Caching**:
   ```javascript
   const fullResponsePromise = axios.post<ApiAskResponse>(`${API_BASE_URL}/ask`, { query: userInput.text })
   ```
   Starts loading the full response in parallel with streaming text, effectively caching the response before it's needed.

### Cache Management Features:

1. **Cache Invalidation**:
   ```python
   # Clear the context blocks cache as it may contain blocks from the deleted file
   context_blocks_cache.clear()
   ```
   The cache is properly cleared when documents are deleted.

2. **Warm-up Loading**:
   ```python
   @app.on_event("startup")
   async def startup_event():
   ```
   Pre-warms the system by loading models and parsing documents into cache on startup.

3. **Smart Local Storage Management**:
   ```javascript
   if (error instanceof DOMException && error.name === 'QuotaExceededError') {
       // Keep only the 5 most recent conversations
   }
   ```
   Manages localStorage quota by keeping only recent conversations when limits are reached.

All these caching mechanisms work together to significantly improve performance, especially after the initial cold start. The multi-level caching approach (embedding level, document level, and query level) provides a robust solution for this RAG application.
