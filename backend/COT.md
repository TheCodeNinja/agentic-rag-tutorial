I'll help implement a multi-step reasoning feature with chain-of-thought approach without changing the existing business logic. Let me analyze the current code structure first.
Read file: backend/app/services/rag_service.py
Read file: backend/app/main.py
Now I'll implement the multi-step reasoning feature with chain-of-thought approach without changing the existing business logic. I'll create a new function in the rag_service.py file and add a new endpoint in main.py.
Now I'll add a new endpoint to the main.py file to expose this chain-of-thought functionality:
Now let's create a simple frontend component to demonstrate the chain-of-thought functionality:
Read file: frontend/src/App.tsx
<no message>
Read file: frontend/src/App.tsx
Now I'll add a button to the frontend to use the chain-of-thought approach:
<no message>
Let's restore the clear messages button that was accidentally removed:
Now let's create a README.md file to explain the implementation:
Let's summarize what we've implemented to add the chain-of-thought reasoning feature to the Agentic RAG system:

1. **Backend Implementation**:
   - Added a new function `get_cot_agentic_answer` in `rag_service.py` that implements the three-step chain-of-thought process:
     - Planning: The LLM analyzes the query and creates a structured plan
     - Enhanced Retrieval: Uses the plan to improve the search query
     - Reasoning-Based Synthesis: Generates a response with explicit reasoning steps
   - Created a new endpoint `/ask/cot` in `main.py` that uses this function
   - Preserved all existing business logic, including image association with questions

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Added a toggle switch in the UI to enable/disable chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Modified the request handling to use the appropriate endpoint based on the toggle state
   - Enhanced the response display to show reasoning process and unanswered aspects when CoT is enabled
   - Maintained compatibility with the existing UI components

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created a README.md file explaining the chain-of-thought implementation
   - Documented the three-step process, API endpoints, and benefits

This implementation successfully adds the requested multi-step reasoning capability without changing any existing business logic. The chain-of-thought approach enhances the system by:

1. Making the reasoning process transparent to users
2. Improving retrieval through better query formulation
3. Identifying gaps in the knowledge base
4. Providing more structured and comprehensive responses

Users can now toggle between the standard RAG approach and the enhanced chain-of-thought approach based on their needs.
